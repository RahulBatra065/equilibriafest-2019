# equilibriafest-2020
Equilibria Fest 2020 Website
 ## Structure
 The frontend will follow a custom revision of the vanilla implementation of the classic version of Express Server 
  with EJS and marked-down rendering
  ```
|
|--index.html
|
|--css/
|------*.css
|
|
|--js/
|------*.js
|
|
|--bower_components/
|------------------materialize
|------------------slick-carousel
|------------------jquery
|
|--LICENSE
```

### To run the website
 Depending on the production stage of the website the command to run the website stage
  #### before the end conversion stage ( wo/ ejs and marked)
 with the assumption that the user has the NPM and the live-server package installed 
 ```
     live-server
  ```



 Alternatively, 
  ```
     npm install -g live-server
     live-server
  ```



#### after or in between the end conversion stage (w/ ejs and marked) a series of command have to be executed to ensure correct rendering of the ejs files
 ```
      npm install 
      npm install express marked
      node install
 ```
### Note
We assume that the user testing the website is running some form of the darwin kernel, this is because the developer uses a Mac which uses a modified version of the darwin kernel, the packages are not tested to run on the windows command prompt (Please consider using WSL2 or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terminal_emulators any of these ) .
It is also in good faith that I do not convert to webpack or yarn simply due to ease and not needing to navigate through the sub modules themselves
### Assumptions
I assume that the user going through the code base has a working knowledge of node.js express materialize and jquery.
Additionally md for github, md rendering and error handling in node.js and express.


## Hosting
The entire frontend is run on a combination of netlify and heroku with bare-minimal cpu usage to ensure minimum costs
However, in the future for mailing sub-systems we may consider using lower end plans
